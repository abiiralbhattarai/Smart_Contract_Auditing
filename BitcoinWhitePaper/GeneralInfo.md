### General Info The Blockchain

1. The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies.

2. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.

3. A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet.

4. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued.

5. Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system.
