1. # Nonce

2. # EOA

   Externally Owned Account, so your normal Ethereum address, not a wallet contract.

   ***

   1. In general, there are two types of accounts: externally owned accounts, controlled by private keys, and contract accounts, controlled by their contract code.

   2. When it comes to EOA, the nonce is equal to the number of transaction sent by an EOA account.

   3. And for the contract accounts, the nonce is equal to the number of contracts saved by the contract accounts.
