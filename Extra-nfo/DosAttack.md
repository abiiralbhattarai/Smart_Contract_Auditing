### Dos(Denial Of Service) Attacks

1. In Solidity, a DoS vulnerability can be simply understood as “unrecoverable malicious manipulation or uncontrolled unlimited resource consumption”

2. There are three types of DoS attacks in smart contracts:
    - Manipulate a map or array loop externally.
    - Owner operation.
    - Progress status based on external calls.
